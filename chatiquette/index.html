        <h1>Chatiquette</h1>

        <p>This is a set of guidelines for proper <strong>chat</strong>
        e<strong>tiquette</strong> in
        <a href='http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/240/the-nineteenth-byte'>The Nineteenth Byte</a>.
        While following these suggestions is a great way to get along, it's
        not, nor will it ever be, a complete list; always use your own
        judgement and self-control.</p>

        <h2>Be nice</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>The main site has
                <a href='http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice'>a Be Nice policy</a>.
                These rules apply in chat just as much as they do there.</li>

            <li>Act welcoming to everyone, especially newcomers. The Nineteenth
                Byte may be a user’s first experience with PPCG, so be a good
                ambassador.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Signal:noise</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>Don't post messages that add nothing to the conversation (^, ಠ_ಠ,
                rofl, etc.) sparingly if at all.</li>

            <li>PPCG-related (on-topic) discussion always overrides idle
                chatter.</li>

            <li>Consider creating a separate chatroom if a topic appears to be
                dominating or preventing effective discussion of other, more
                relevant topics.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Requests</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>Stay on-topic with questions, and avoiding asking unrelated
                "homework" questions.</li>

            <li>Do at least minimal research before asking questions that
                aren't directly related to a challenge (Google is your
                friend).</li>

            <li>For questions about the site,
                <a href="https://meta.codegolf.stackexchange.com">Meta</a> and
                the <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/help">Help Center</a>
                are your friends.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Courtesy</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>Don't post huge oneboxes, unnecessary GIFs, or messages with
                superfluous formatting / Unicode.</li>

            <li>Only ping people to notify them of something that requires
                their attention, not every time you mention them.</li>

            <li>Avoid repeatedly editing messages that contain pings.</li>

        </ul>
